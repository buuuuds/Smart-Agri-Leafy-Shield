# 🌾 Project Overview

**Smart Agri-Leafy Shield** is an IoT-based automated crop protection system that helps farmers combat  
**heat stress**, **soil moisture imbalance**, **sun overexposure**, and **inconsistent weather conditions**.

The system automates:
- 🌤️ Shading  
- 💧 Irrigation  
- 🌫️ Cooling via ultrasonic misting  
- 📊 Real-time environmental monitoring  
- ☁️ Cloud logging (Firebase)

Designed for **small-scale Filipino farmers**, the system improves crop health, reduces labor, and supports climate-resilient agriculture.

# 🧪 How the System Works

### 1️⃣ Hardware Setup
- Connect sensors, servo motor, solenoid valve, and misting module.  
- Assemble shading and irrigation mechanisms.

### 2️⃣ Upload Code
- Flash Arduino microcontroller firmware.  
- Configure ESP32 with WiFi credentials and Firebase API keys.

### 3️⃣ Cloud Setup
- Add Firebase API configuration.  
- Enable Realtime Database and set data paths.

### 4️⃣ System Operation
- **Soil too dry →** Irrigation automatically turns ON  
- **High temperature →** Misting system activates  
- **Excess sunlight →** Shade cloth deploys  
- **All sensor data →** Uploaded to cloud for remote monitoring
